1) Check out the python chess code again.

2) Pick a function in it.
For example: state2str(self) or parseTextMove or checkKingGuard

You can pick a full function or part of one.

Write your name on the top of the function in a comment, and check it
back in, to show other people that your group is working on this function.
(Don't claim functions others have claimed.)

3) Create a test for that function, using pythons 'unittest' module.

Start with a small test, of a very small area of functionality.
A given function can, and often should, have multiple tests.

4) Run the test. Check the test works.

5) Refactor your claimed function into another file, so that its separate
in the project. Update your test.

6) Liase with other groups working on similar functionality, to get your
functions into an appropriate other file together.

We want not one large file with everything in it, but several smaller files,
each with a coherent set of modules.

7) Commit your changes to the repository.
Integrate, check everything works.

Break something, check your tests find the breakage.

8) Write an 'end-to-end' test using the test harness; check the game
plays out according to the moves specified in the moves file.
